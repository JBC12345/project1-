<h1>Yankee Hat and Back <br> Namadgi National Park</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2> 
<p> Yankee Hat is a mountain located in Namadgi National Park, Canberra, Australian Capital Territory. At the base of the mountain is an Aboriginal rock shelter. The rock shelter displays centuries old Aboriginal rock art. The purpose of our trip was to submit the Yankee Hat via the rock shelter. As a party of four we set off at 9.00am on a brisk October morning. </p>


<h2>Getting There</h2>

<h2>Carpark to the rock art</h2> 

<p>The route from the carpark to the rock art is stunning. Walking across wide open land with a backdrop of some of the ACT’s largest mountains is ominous. You feel like you are very small and have a long way to travel. This grassland is prime ground for the kangaroos who awkwardly stare at you from a distance. 45 minutes later we were admiring the rock art and contemplating the history of this ancient place.</p>

<h2>Rock art to Yankee Hat</h2>

<p>We foolishly decided that it would be quickest to shoot a 240 degree magnetic bearing to attack the summit with a direct route. This meant climbing, then descending then climbing again. The up and down nature of the route was exhausting but the views of the open ground back to the carpark from the first ridge line were magnificent. It was on this ridge we received a light dusting of snow (a rare occurrence for this time of year). </p>

<p> After nearly 5 hours of bush bashing we made it to the summit. Here we took off our boots, made some tea and watch the sun set over Mt Gudgenby. <p/>

<h2>Return leg</h2>

<p>We decided it was best not to repeat the rollercoaster journey of yesterday and agreed that it was best to descend in the valley that runs south west to the open ground. Once we found open ground we followed our nose along the fire trails to the carpark. This route was abundantly easier and took us half the time. <p> 

<h2>Recommendations</h2>

<ul>
<li>Topographic maps do no do justice to how steep some mountains slopes are. Take the longer but more gentle gradient where possible.</li>
<li>Pack 4 litres of water per person per 24 hours. We did not come across any running water.</li>
<li>Pack warm clothes! The mercury dropped below zero despite it being mid Spring.</li> 
<li>Wear long pants and a long sleeve top. This will save you from the sun and from getting scratched up.</li> 
</ul>
